## Summary

Uforia allows users to create their own account and keep track of daily habits they want to improve on in their lives. After creating an account and logging in the user gets directed to their home page where they can create a new daily goal which gets placed into their 'Goals queue' section. After creating a list of goals they would like to work on they can pick out of their 'Goals queue' to select ones to start working on by clicking 'Start' and it put those goals into the 'Current goals' section, which they will start keeping track of by clicking the 'Mark it!' button if they completed it for that day. If they don't mark the goal complete for 24 hours the goal gets placed back into their 'Goals queue' and the user must start that task over again. The idea is to turn these daily goals into habits and that usually happens after 60 consecutive days of completing the goals.
